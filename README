0x00: Overview
    LambdaScape is a collection of programs that provides a framework for
    writing and testing autonomous robots in a simulated physical world.
    The server, lambda.py, accepts connections from observers such as
    lambdascape and robots.
    
    Observers request the terrain from the server and receive robot position
    matrix updates.
    
    Robots can cast a ray in a direction and get back the distance to the
    closest solid surface, much like a LIDAR sensor. Robots are rocket-powered
    because it's so much easier than using wheels.

0x01: Dependencies
    LambdaScape is quite needy and demands that you provide it with libraries.
    
    sudo apt-get install python-2.5 python-pyode ghc6 libghc6-glut-dev \
        libghc6-network-dev libghc6-parallel-dev libghc6-time-dev
    
    If you don't have apt-get, get it. The haskell libraries may be skipped if
    you obtain a pre-built distribution.

0x02: Building from Source
    make clean && make

0x03: Running All the Pieces
    ./lambda.py --port=9001 & \
        ./lambdascape 9001 & \
        nc localhost 9001
    
    For navigation keybindings, press F1 within lambdascape.
    See the next section for what to type at the prompt.

0x04: Robots Running Amok
    Robots connect to the server and identify with their name and position. The
    coordinate system of the world is z-up. Example:
        killbot 0 0 15
    
    Robots can fire their thrusters in any direction with any amount of force.
    Example:
        force 1000 0 30000
    
    Robots can cast a ray and query the distance to the closest surface. The ray
    is specified as a vector relative to the robot's current position which need
    not be normalized.
    Example:
        lidar 1 3 0
    
    Both robots and observers can "quit" and "shutdown" the service by stating
    as such.
